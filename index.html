            <p class = "main_par"><strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumong_(TV_series)" target = "_blank">Jumong</a></strong> (Hangul: 삼한지-주몽 편; Hanja: 三韓志-朱蒙篇주몽; RR: <em>Samhanji-Jumong Pyeon</em>; lit. "The Book of the Three Hans: The Chapter of Jumong") is a South Korean historical period drama series that aired on MBC from 2006 to 2007 as the network's 45th anniversary special. Originally scheduled for 60 episodes, MBC extended it to 81 because of its popularity.</p>
            <h2>Jumong is a famous historical Korean Drama series</h2>
            <p class = "main_par">The series examines the life of Jumong, founder of the kingdom of Goguryeo.<br> 
            Few details have been found in the historical record about Jumong, so much of the series is fictionalized. The fantastic elements surrounding the original Jumong legend (such as those concerning his birth) have been replaced with events more grounded in reality. Jumong is considered part of the Korean Wave (Hallyu), with viewership in Iran exceeding 80 percent.</p>
